     IF THE MODEL HAS PASSED THE PREVIOUS CHECKS FOR THE G-SET AND N-SET,
     THEN SOME POSSIBLE CAUSES ARE:
       1. THE MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO BE FREE-FREE WHICH INDICATES THAT THE MODEL IS
          PROPERLY CONSTRAINED TO GROUND;
       2. THE REFERENCE GRID POINT (GRID=GID ON THE GROUNDCHECK COMMAND) IS LOCATED
          TOO FAR FROM THE MODEL'S CENTER OF GRAVITY. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE
          REFERENCE GRID POINT BE LOCATED AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE MODEL'S CENTER
          OF GRAVITY OF THE MODEL (SEE THE GRID POINT WEIGHT GENERATOR OUTPUT);
       3. PARAM,AUTOSPC,YES CONSTRAINS NEAR-SINGULAR DEGREES-OF-FREEDOM. WHEN A
          FINITE ELEMENT MODEL WITH AUTOSPC FAILS THE A-SET CHECK, IT IS NOT EVIDENT
          THAT GROUNDING HAS OCCURRED. THE USE OF PARAM,SNORM WILL NOT ELIMINATE THE
          SPURIOUS FAILURE.
